        Time Magazine has named iPhone 5 its Gadget of the Year for 2012. The device is “one of the most artfully polished gadgets anyone’s ever built,” says Time’s Harry McCracken. He highlights the new thinner design and the camera’s “particularly well-done panorama mode.” McCracken concludes, “[W]hen it comes to melding hardware, software and services so tightly that the seams fade away, Apple still has no peer.” The 
MacBook Pro with Retina display also made it onto the list at number six.        </li>

        PC Mag has added Apple’s new iMac to its Editor’s Choice list for high-end all-in-one desktops.

He concludes, “With its beautiful design and quality fabrication, the iMac 27-inch is the best all-in-one desktop we’ve ever seen.”        </li>

        Reporting in the Sydney Morning Herald, Garry Barker describes how Apple accessibility technology has enabled disabled users to thrive both personally and professionally. Barker tells the story of David Woodbridge, a technology manager for a large non-profit who has been blind since childhood. Woodbridge uses VoiceOver and other assistive technologies in Apple’s iOS devices daily. “With VoiceOver I can support not only myself but also my boys and my wife,” said Woodbridge. “For example, if my wife gets an SMS when she is driving I can call up VoiceOver on her iPhone to read the message to her and we can reply using Siri, which is one of the great iOS developments, getting better all the time.”        </li>
